**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** June 2025  
**Effective Date:** June 2025

## Executive Summary

The Valid Mint - Email Domain Validation API ("Service") operates on a **zero-knowledge, zero-storage** architecture. This policy details our commitment to data protection and privacy through technical design that makes data retention impossible.

**Core Privacy Guarantee:** We process validation requests in real-time memory only. No user-submitted data is ever written to disk, logged, or retained in any form.

## 1. Scope and Definitions

### 1.1 Service Description

The Valid Mint - Email Domain Validation API provides real-time validation of email domains through DNS lookups, disposable domain detection, and deliverability analysis.

### 1.2 Key Definitions

- **User Data**: Any domain name or email address submitted for validation
- **Validation Data**: Results generated from processing user data
- **Public Data**: DNS records and known disposable domain lists
- **Zero-Storage Architecture**: Technical design preventing any persistent storage of user data

### 1.3 Policy Scope

This policy applies to all data processing activities performed by our API service. It does not cover data handling by third-party platforms (see Section 9).

## 2. Data Categories and Processing

### 2.1 Input Data Categories

| Data Type       | Example            | Processing             | Retention           |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Domain Names    | `example.com`      | Real-time validation   | None (0 seconds)    |
| Email Addresses | `user@example.com` | Domain extraction only | None (0 seconds)    |
| Request IDs     | `req-123-abc`      | Request correlation    | Duration of request |
| API Keys        | Via RapidAPI       | Authentication only    | Not processed by us |

### 2.2 Generated Data Categories

| Data Type           | Purpose              | Retention                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Validation Results  | API response payload | Duration of HTTP response     |
| Request UUIDs       | Request tracking     | Duration of request           |
| Performance Metrics | Service monitoring   | Aggregated only, no user data |
| Error Messages      | Debugging            | Generic only, no user data    |

### 2.3 Data We Never Collect

- Personal identifying information beyond domain names
- IP addresses (handled by infrastructure layer)
- Browser fingerprints or device information
- Usage patterns or behavioral data
- Email content or metadata

## 3. Technical Privacy Implementation

### 3.1 Zero-Storage Architecture

Our technical architecture enforces privacy through design:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Request   │────▶│  In-Memory   │────▶│  Response   │
│   (Input)   │     │  Processing  │     │  (Output)   │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                           │
                           ▼
                    [Immediate Disposal]
```

**Technical Guarantees:**

- ✅ No database connections for user data
- ✅ No file system writes of user data
- ✅ No persistent caching of user inputs
- ✅ No session management or state tracking
- ✅ Memory cleared after each request

### 3.2 Processing Pipeline

| Stage              | Action                   | Data Handling |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| 1. Input Reception | Receive domain/email     | Memory only   |
| 2. Validation      | Parse and extract domain | Memory only   |
| 3. DNS Lookup      | Query public DNS         | No storage    |
| 4. Analysis        | Check disposable/typos   | Memory only   |
| 5. Response        | Return JSON results      | Memory only   |
| 6. Cleanup         | Clear all variables      | Automatic GC  |

### 3.3 Stateless Design Principles

- **Request Isolation**: Each API call is completely independent
- **No Correlation**: Impossible to link requests from same user
- **No History**: Previous validations cannot be retrieved
- **No Learning**: Service doesn't adapt based on usage
- **Idempotent Operations**: Same input always produces same output

## 4. Security and Privacy Controls

### 4.1 Logging and Monitoring

#### What We Log

| Log Type      | Data Included                       | Data Excluded                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Access Logs   | Timestamp, HTTP method, Status code | Domain names, IP addresses   |
| Error Logs    | Error type, Stack trace             | User inputs, Request content |
| Performance   | Response time, Cache metrics        | Specific domains validated   |
| Health Checks | Service status, Uptime              | No user data involved        |

#### Logging Security Measures

- Structured logging with explicit field filtering
- Automatic redaction of potential user data
- Log rotation without long-term storage
- No query parameter logging

### 4.2 Caching Strategy

**DNS Response Cache:**

- **Purpose**: Improve performance for common DNS queries
- **Key Design**: Hashed DNS responses, not domain names
- **Scope**: Public DNS data only
- **Duration**: 5-minute TTL
- **Privacy**: Cannot reverse-engineer queried domains

### 4.3 Cryptographic Controls

```rust
// Example: How we handle sensitive operations
pub fn process_domain(input: &str) -> ValidationResult {
    let domain = extract_domain(input);
    let result = validate(domain);
    // domain variable goes out of scope here
    // Rust's ownership ensures memory cleanup
    result
}
```

## 5. External Data Sources and Integrations

### 5.1 Public Data Sources

| Source Type                     | Purpose             | Privacy Impact       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Public DNS (Cloudflare, Google) | Domain verification | No user data shared  |
| Disposable Domain Lists         | Spam detection      | Public datasets only |
| Major Email Providers           | Typo detection      | Public provider list |
| IANA TLD Database               | Domain validation   | Public registry data |

### 5.2 Data Flow Isolation

```
User Request → Our API → Public DNS
     ↓             ↓         ↓
[No Storage] [No Logging] [No Tracking]
```

### 5.3 Third-Party Privacy Commitments

- **DNS Queries**: Use DNS-over-HTTPS for privacy
- **No Data Enrichment**: We don't enhance data with third-party services
- **No Analytics Services**: No Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
- **No CDN Tracking**: Static assets served without user tracking

| Layer          | Protection       | Implementation                  |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Transport      | TLS 1.3+         | All API endpoints HTTPS-only    |
| DNS            | DoH/DoT          | Encrypted DNS resolution        |
| Application    | Input validation | Strict domain format validation |
| Infrastructure | Firewall rules   | Minimal attack surface          |

### 6.2 Application Security

**Memory Safety:**

- Written in Rust for memory safety guarantees
- No buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities
- Automatic memory cleanup via RAII

**Input Validation:**

```
// Domain validation example
- Maximum length: 253 characters
- Valid characters: a-z, 0-9, hyphen, dot
- No SQL injection possible (no database)
- No path traversal (no file operations)
```

### 6.3 Operational Security

- **Deployment**: Immutable container deployments
- **Updates**: Automated security patches
- **Monitoring**: Performance metrics only, no user data
- **Incident Response**: Service restart clears all memory

The Valid Mint - Email Domain Validation API represents a privacy-first approach to domain validation services. By implementing a stateless, zero-storage architecture, we eliminate traditional privacy risks associated with data processing services.

**Key Differentiators:**

1. **Technical Impossibility**: Not policy-based privacy, but architecture-based
2. **No Data Lifecycle**: No creation, storage, retention, or deletion phases
3. **Compliance Simplification**: No data means simplified compliance
4. **Audit Trail**: No user data trail exists to audit
5. **Breach Immunity**: No stored data means no data breaches

**Risk Assessment:**

- **Data Breach Risk**: None (no data storage)
- **Compliance Risk**: Minimal (no data retention)
- **Third-Party Risk**: Limited to RapidAPI platform
- **Technical Risk**: Memory-only processing
